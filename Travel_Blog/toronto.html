      <h1 class = "center">TORONTO, CANADA</h1>

      <p class = "blog_writing">
        Toronto, Canada was my 21st birthday trip! We flew in on Friday, July 28th and left that Sunday. All day Friday and Sunday were spent in the city of Toronto.
        Friday was spent exploring the city and going to museums. After breakfast, we headed to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Even though I have never watched a hockey game,
         I'm glad we went. I especially liked the antique games on display and all of the rings. Next, we went to AGO which was a great museum. My favorite part was the Wolfgang
          Tilman exhibit. Lastly, we explored Chinatown and got yummy dumplings. We finished the night off with dinner by the hotel.<br><br>On Sunday, before our flight home, we took the ferry to Toronto Islands. This was so unexpectedly fun and we wish we had more time. We bought all day passes 
            to the amusement park. We were definately the oldest people on the rides, but we didn't care! If we had more time, we would rent paddle boards and jet skis. One thing that really surprised me 
            was that I had to best bbq of my life in Toronto!
