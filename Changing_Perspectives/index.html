                <p>In the 1940s, the term "computer" referred to the predominantly female workforce engaged in computational tasks, 
                  crucial for military and scientific efforts during World War II. This period emphasized women's central role in computing, 
                  treating programming as women's work. However, despite their critical contributions, these tasks were seen as low-status, 
                  reflecting societal perceptions that marginalized women's professional capabilities.

          <div class="text-container">
              <p>As computing began to professionalize in the 1950s with the advent of machines like ENIAC and UNIVAC, 
                which were initially programmed by women, perceptions of computing shifted from manual, 
                clerical tasks to a technological and intellectual profession. This era marked the beginning of a transition, 
                subtly starting to alter the gender dynamics in computing, as the field gained prominence and recognition within state and industrial frameworks.

              <p>The space race of the 1960s further advanced computing technology, associating computers with industrial and social modernity. 
                This period began to subtly push expectations toward young men to become the new experts in computer technology, particularly in roles like 
                system design, subtly sidelining women from emerging opportunities and recognition in the growing field of computer science.

              <p>With the introduction of personal computers and GUIs in the 1970s, computing expanded into various industries, 
                marking the beginning of significant technological shifts. This decade saw the professionalization of computing, which, 
                through formalizing qualifications and roles, inadvertently began to displace women from the domains they had previously dominated, 
                pushing them towards software development, perceived as a less prestigious sector.

              <p>The personal computer revolution of the 1980s profoundly impacted gender dynamics within computing. 
                The marketing of personal computers as tools for boys, coupled with cultural portrayals of computer geeks as predominantly male, 
                significantly reduced women's participation in computer science. This decline was a direct result of the growing perception of computing 
                as a male domain, heavily influenced by the era's marketing strategies and societal stereotypes.

              <p>The 1990s witnessed significant technological advances, including the rise of the internet and the 
                proliferation of personal computing, which transformed the landscape of computer science. As the tech industry boomed,
                 initiatives were launched to counter the declining participation of women in computer science, with outreach programs, scholarships,
                  and efforts to make curricula more inclusive. However, despite these efforts, the rapid expansion of the tech industry was predominantly
                   male-driven. This period's technological advances, while groundbreaking, coincided with a persistently low representation of women in the 
                   field, reflecting broader systemic issues that continued to marginalize women in computing.

          <div class="text-container">
              <p>The 2000s saw the internet becoming ubiquitous, and digital technologies becoming integral to daily life and work, 
                further emphasizing the importance of computing skills. This era brought a heightened awareness of the gender gap in STEM fields, 
                including computer science. Initiatives like coding camps and mentorship programs were introduced to engage girls and young women, 
                aiming to bridge this gap. However, these efforts encountered significant challenges in overcoming entrenched societal and professional barriers. 
                The digital divide—the gap between those with easy access to digital technology and those without—mirrored and perhaps even exacerbated the 
                gender gap in computer science, as access to technology became increasingly linked to success in the field.

          <div class="text-container">
              <p>The 2010s marked a period of intense technological innovation, with advancements in artificial intelligence, 
                machine learning, and big data reshaping the future of work and society. Amidst this backdrop, there was a renewed emphasis on 
                diversity and inclusion in the tech industry and academia. High-profile campaigns and corporate diversity initiatives sought to 
                create more welcoming environments and encourage participation among underrepresented groups in STEM fields, including women. 
                Governments and educational institutions doubled down on efforts to address gender imbalances, integrating coding and computational 
                thinking into earlier stages of education and promoting STEM careers among girls and women. Despite these initiatives, challenges persisted, 
                underscoring the complexity of dismantling underlying structures of power and exclusion. The decade's technological advancements highlighted 
                the critical need for diverse perspectives in shaping the future of technology and innovation, making the push for gender equality in 
                computer science more urgent than ever.

              <p>The beginning of the 2020s brought significant advances in cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), 
                and the Internet of Things (IoT), mirroring the transformative tech changes of previous decades. 
                This era, however, was uniquely shaped by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the adoption of digital and remote technologies, 
                highlighting the critical role of connectivity in modern life. Amid these advancements, the tech industry faced renewed scrutiny over its 
                historical gaps in diversity and inclusion. Efforts to increase representation among women and people of color in tech gained new momentum, 
                echoing the early and pivotal contributions of women in the 1940s who were central to computing's origins. This period emphasized the 
                importance of drawing lessons from past efforts to address gender and racial disparities in the field. Initiatives aimed at fostering 
                inclusive cultures and dismantling systemic barriers to entry and advancement in STEM careers became more pronounced. While these efforts 
                marked steps toward correcting long-standing inequities, the continued underrepresentation in tech roles, especially in leadership, 
                highlighted the need for ongoing action. The push for diversity and inclusion in the 2020s, against a backdrop of rapid technological evolution, 
                reflects a crucial lesson from computing history: innovation achieves its greatest potential when it is fueled by a wide range of perspectives.
